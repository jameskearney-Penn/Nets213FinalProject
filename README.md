## Major Components of our Project

Setting up our data ->
We need to aggregate the wikipedia trending topics data in order to create HITs. In order to do this we will use an online dataset from AWS of Wikipedia trending topics and create a CSV file out of the data. The CSV of trending wikipedia pages will then be inputted into our HITs. (Point Value: 2)

Build our HITs ->
We need to build our HITs on mechanical Turk and determine the best design in order for Mechanical Turk workers to properly analyze trending topics. The general design of the HIT can be seen in the mockup pdf supplied in the repository. (Point Value: 4)

Aggregate the results ->
We need to aggregate the data from Mechanical Turk and insure that we received quality. We will do this by the methods specified in the flow chart (Point Value: 3).

Display the results ->
We need to build a proper interface in order to display our findings from this project. We will do this by posting an article online displaying our results detailing top trending wikipedia articles. (Point Value: 4)
