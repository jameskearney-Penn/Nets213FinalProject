Our project, What’sWiki, aims to have workers deem and summarize if/why popular Wikipedia articles for a given month are trending.

HIT 1: Decide and Describe:

For a given HIT, decide whether or not a given Wikipedia article is trending for the month. If an  article is “trending”, it means that it is popular this month due to recent events. For example, an article titled “Kobe Bryant” would be trending for January 2020 due to his death in a helicopter crash, but an article titled “Google” in January 2020 would not be considered trending, as no recent events caused its spike in popularity (it is just an article title that is always popular). If an article is deemed trending, please write a 1-2 sentence summary as to why it is trending. Please refer to the link if you want more information on the topic.


HIT 2: Score by Importance:

For a given HIT, a user will be given a link to a Wikipedia article and a corresponding description of why this article was relevant in a stated month and year. It is the job of the worker to score from 1 to 10 how important the article/description is to the events of the given month. A score of 1 should indicate that the given description is not at all important the events of the month and a score of 10 should indicate that the given description is very notable to the events of the month. You will assign this score to each description.
